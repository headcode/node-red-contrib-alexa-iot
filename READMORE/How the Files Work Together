How the Files Work Together

Here’s how the files collaborate to achieve the module’s purpose:

Module Setup (package.json):

Registers the alexa-iot-hub and alexa-iot-device nodes with Node-RED.
Specifies dependencies like node-red-contrib-alexa-smart-home for Alexa communication and express for the hub’s server.

Hub Node Configuration (alexa-iot-hub.html):

Provides a UI for users to set the hub’s port and debug mode.
Ensures the port is valid, which is critical for the Express server to listen for Alexa requests.

Hub Node Logic (alexa-iot-hub.js):

Runs an Express server to handle Alexa Smart Home requests.
For device discovery, it scans all Node-RED nodes to find alexa-iot-device nodes linked to it (via hub property) and sends their IDs and names to Alexa as endpoints.
For directives (e.g., TurnOn, SetBrightness), it translates Alexa commands into Node-RED messages (e.g., topic: "power", payload: "ON") and sends them to the corresponding device node using its ID.

Device Node Configuration (alexa-iot-device.html):

Provides a UI for users to set a unique device name (used in Alexa discovery) and link to a hub.
Allows optional selection of a targetNode for forwarding messages, making the device node versatile in flows.

Device Node Logic (alexa-iot-device.js):

Processes messages from the hub, standardizing payloads (e.g., converting power to “ON”/“OFF”, clamping brightness to 0–100).
Outputs messages to the Node-RED flow and optionally forwards them to a targetNode, enabling control of other nodes or devices.
