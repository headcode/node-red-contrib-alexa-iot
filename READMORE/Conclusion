Conclusion

The node-red-contrib-alexa-iot module effectively creates a Node-RED palette with a hub node and multiple device nodes to enable Alexa voice control.

The hub node (alexa-iot-hub) listens for Alexa requests, handles device discovery by listing linked device nodes, and forwards directives to the appropriate device nodes.

The device nodes (alexa-iot-device) process these messages and integrate with Node-RED flows, supporting power, brightness, and color control.

The provided files work together seamlessly to provide a local, flexible solution for controlling devices via Amazon Echo.
